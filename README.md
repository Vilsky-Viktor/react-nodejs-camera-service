# AnyVision test project

1. Clone project to your local directory
2. There are 2 parts: back-end & front-end and they sit under folders server and client respectively. Go to the root folders of both projects and run npm install
3. Make sure mongo DB is installed or you have an access to a cloud DB
4. Rename .env.example files for both projects and fill with your credentials
5. Run both projects via npm start

That's it, have a fun :)
